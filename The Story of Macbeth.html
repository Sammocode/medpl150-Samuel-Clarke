    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Macbeth</h3>
     <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>“Is this a dagger which I see before me, the handle toward my hand?”</em></p>
     <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>“Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow…”</em></p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
    Shakespeare’s <strong>Macbeth</strong> is more than a tale of murder and madness; it's a psychological descent into the cost of ambition. 
    Macbeth begins as a noble warrior, but the prophecy of three witches ignites a hunger that consumes him. His journey is marked by betrayal, hallucination, and the erosion of identity.
    These line captures the surreal pull of fate; Macbeth doesn’t just act; he’s haunted into action. The dagger isn’t real, but the consequences are. 
    Lady Macbeth, too, is a force of ambition, urging him forward until guilt becomes unbearable. Her descent into madness mirrors his, but hers is quieter, more internal.
    The story’s symbols; blood, darkness, and the supernatural; aren’t just storytelling devices. They reflect the emotional residue of unchecked desire. 
    Macbeth’s crown is won through violence, but it never fits. His story reminds us that power without peace is a curse. </p>

    <img src="Witch Manipulated King.jpg" alt="Witch Manipulated King" width="400" height="500">

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">First Witch</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!</em></p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Second Witch</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!</em></p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Third Witch</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!</em></p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">First Witch</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>Lesser than Macbeth and greater.</em></p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Second Witch</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>Not so happy, yet much happier.</em></p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Third Witch</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</em></p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
      In this scene, the three witches greet Macbeth with three titles: <strong>Thane of Glamis, Thane of Cawdor, and future King of Scotland</strong>;foretelling his rise to power.
      They also speak to Banquo, offering paradoxical prophecies: he will be <em>“lesser than Macbeth and greater,”</em> <em>“not so happy, yet much happier,”</em> 
      and though he won’t be king himself, his descendants will be kings. These cryptic messages spark ambition and foreshadow the tension between fate, power, and legacy.

    <img src="Macbeth Kills King Duncan.jpg" alt="Macbeth Kills King Duncan" width="550" height="400">

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 1</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      “Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br>
      This handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.<br>
      I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<br>
      Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible<br>
      To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but<br>
      A dagger of the mind, a false creation,<br>
      Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?”
    </em></p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 2</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      Whence is that knocking? –<br>
      How is’t with me, when every noise appalls me?<br>
      What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.<br>
      Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood<br>
      Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather<br>
      The multitudinous seas incarnadine,<br>
      Making the green one red.
    </em></p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
      In these pivotal scenes, Macbeth wrestles with his conscience before and after murdering King Duncan.
      In Scene 1, he hallucinates a floating dagger leading him toward Duncan’s chamber; a symbol of his inner turmoil and violent intent.
      He questions whether the dagger is real or a projection of his “heat-oppressed brain,” revealing his <strong>psychological</strong> descent.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
      In Scene 2, after committing the murder, Macbeth is overwhelmed by guilt and paranoia. He’s haunted by every sound, unable to say “Amen,”
      and fixated on the blood on his hands. He wonders if even “Neptune’s ocean” could wash away the guilt, concluding that his crime has stained
      everything; turning “the green one red.” These scenes mark the beginning of Macbeth’s unraveling, as ambition gives way to psychological torment.

    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Act 5, Scene 1 – Lady Macbeth’s Bloody Hands</h2>
    <img src="Lady Macbeth Blood on Her Hands.jpg" alt="Lady Macbeth Blood on Her Hands" width="400" height="500">

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Lady Macbeth</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      “Out, damned spot! Out, I say! . . . who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.”
    </em> (5.1.25–28)</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Lady Macbeth</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      “I am in blood<br>
      Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,<br>
      Returning were as tedious as go o’er.”
    </em> (3.4.142–144)</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      When Lady Macbeth returns from Duncan’s chamber she holds out her blood-stained hands and says, “My hands are of your colour,
      but I shame to wear a heart so white,” claiming that although she has Duncan’s blood on her hands she feels no guilt whatsoever.
    </em></p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
      Lady Macbeth’s descent into guilt is symbolized by her obsession with blood on her hands. Early on, she claims to feel no remorse,
      saying her hands are as bloody as Macbeth’s but she’s not weak-hearted like him. However, by Act 5, she’s sleepwalking and haunted by
      invisible stains, famously crying, <em>“Out, damned spot!”</em>; a sign that guilt has consumed her. Her earlier confidence collapses
      under the weight of what she’s done. The line <em>“I am in blood stepped in so far…”</em> reflects how both she and Macbeth feel trapped by their crimes,
      too deep to turn back. Blood becomes a symbol of guilt, and Lady Macbeth’s mental breakdown shows that even the strongest façade can’t hold against the truth.
    </p>
    
  <p  style="font-family:'Courier New'">
    In the end, Macbeth realizes that all his striving was for a flicker of control in a world ruled by chaos. His tragedy is not just his death, but the hollow legacy he leaves behind.
