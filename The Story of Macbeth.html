  <h2 style="font-family:verdana">The Tragedy of a Man, Who Listened to Ghosts</h2>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Macbeth</h3>
     <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>“I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent, but only vaulting ambition, which o’erleaps itself and falls on the other.”</em> (Act 1, Scene 7)</p>
     <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>“Out, out, brief candle! Life’s but a walking shadow…”</em></p>
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
    Shakespeare’s <strong>Macbeth</strong> is more than a tale of murder and madness, it’s a meditation on ambition that leaps beyond reason. 
    Macbeth begins as a noble warrior, but the witches’ prophecy doesn’t force his hand; it awakens a hunger he can barely control.
    The first line reveals the core of his conflict: he has no real justification for killing Duncan, only a restless drive that threatens 
    to collapse under its own weight. His downfall isn’t just external; it’s psychological. He doesn’t simply chase power; he overreaches,
    and in doing so, loses himself.</p>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Lady Macbeth mirrors this descent. She urges him forward, masking her own unraveling until guilt seeps through the 
        cracks. Her ambition is sharp, but her breakdown is quieter; marked by sleepwalking and imagined bloodstains. The symbols of the story blood, darkness, 
        and the supernatural; aren’t just dramatic flourishes. They reflect the emotional residue of unchecked desire and the cost of chasing power without peace.
        Macbeth’s crown is won through violence, but it never fits. His story reminds us that ambition without grounding isn’t strength; it’s self-sabotage.
        And when you leap too far, sometimes there’s no landing at all.</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">In Act 1, Scene 3, the three Witches greet Macbeth startlingly and unexpectedly. The first Witch calls him <strong>“Thane of Glamis,” </strong>
      already his title, because of Sinel’s death. But then the Witches call him <strong>“Thane of Cawdor”</strong> and <strong>“King Hereafter,”</strong> thus prophesying that he will 
      be promoted to Thane of Cawdor and then king. Macbeth has always dreamed of becoming king, so he is unnerved to hear his ambition said aloud. The Witches’ prediction sets in motion 
      the plot of the play, as Macbeth and his wife murder to ensure that he will become, and stay, king.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> After the Witches prophesied that Macbeth would be king in Act 1, scene 3, Banquo asks what his future holds. 
      The witches tell him he’ll be less happy than Macbeth but far happier, and predict that Banquo will never be king, but his descendants will be. 
      Macbeth will soon murder Banquo to try to keep this from happening, but he will fail to kill Banquo’s son, Fleance, who could end up making the witches’
      prophecy come true.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 1</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      “Is this a dagger which I see before me,<br>
      This handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.<br>
      I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<br>
      Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible<br>
      To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but<br>
      A dagger of the mind, a false creation,<br>
      Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?”

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 2</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      Whence is that knocking? –<br>
      How is’t with me, when every noise appalls me?<br>
      What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.<br>
      Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood<br>
      Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather<br>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Macbeth’s soliloquy in Act 2, Scene 1, is important as it marks the first time he hallucinates. 
      We can assume the Witches he saw earlier were real, because Banquo saw them too. In these lines, however, Macbeth is aware that the 
      floating knife he sees is not really there. The fact that he is troubled enough to hallucinate, yet still sane enough to understand that he 
      is hallucinating, can be contrasted with his later mental state, when he fully believes he sees Banquo’s ghost, even though Lady Macbeth tells 
      him no one is there.</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Macbeth says these lines in Act 2, Scene 2, immediately after murdering Duncan. He hears a knocking at the 
      gate to the castle, and thinks it must be his doom coming to claim him. This moment, now that the dreadful deed is done, shows Macbeth what the
      rest of his life will be like: he will become king, but he also will be wracked with guilt and sure that supernatural elements are warning him of 
      his imminent death.</p>

    <img src="Lady Macbeth Blood on Her Hands.jpg" alt="Lady Macbeth Blood on Her Hands" width="400" height="500">

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Lady Macbeth</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      “Out, damned spot! Out, I say! . . . who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him.”
    </em> (5.1.25–28)</p>

    <h3 style="font-family:verdana">Lady Macbeth</h3>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      “I am in blood<br>
      Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more,<br>
      Returning were as tedious as go o’er.”
    </em> (3.4.142–144)</p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"><em>
      When Lady Macbeth returns from Duncan’s chamber she holds out her blood-stained hands and says, “My hands are of your colour,
      but I shame to wear a heart so white,” claiming that although she has Duncan’s blood on her hands she feels no guilt whatsoever.

    <a href=https://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/macbeth/quotes/character/macbeth/>Lady Macbeth</a>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
      Lady Macbeth speaks these words at the end of the play, wandering around the castle in a delirium, trying to wash out an invisible bloodstain,
      a symbol of her guilt. At the beginning of the play, Lady Macbeth appears more ruthless than her husband, but by the end of the play, she finally 
      succumbs to the looming guilt for her crimes, and she is unable to cope with the reality of what she’s done.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">After Lady Macbeth excuses the guests from the banquet hall, she turns to Macbeth to answer for his crazed outbursts. 
      Shaken from seeing the ghost of Banquo, Macbeth now believes he is no longer safe, even from the dead, and is committed to doing whatever he needs to do to
      secure his safety. With the words <em>“I am in blood / Stepped in so far,”</em> Macbeth reveals to his wife that he has already killed so many people that 
      it will be too difficult to go back to being good. Here, blood symbolizes both Macbeth’s guilt and his newfound resolve to preserve his own life.</p>
    
  <p  style="font-family:'Courier New'">
    In the end, Macbeth realizes that all his striving was for a flicker of control in a world ruled by chaos. His tragedy is not just his death, but the hollow legacy he leaves behind.
