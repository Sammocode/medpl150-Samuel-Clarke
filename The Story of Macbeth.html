<h2>Act 1, Scene 3-The 3 Witches Prophecies</h2>

  <h3>First Witch</h3>
<p><em>All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Glamis!</em></p>
  <h3>Second Witch</h3>
  <p><em>All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!</em></p>
  <h3>Third Witch</h3>
<p><em>All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be king hereafter!</em></p>
  <h3>First Witch</h3>
  <p><em>Lesser than Macbeth and greater.</em></p>
<h3>Second Witch</h3>
    <p><em>Not so happy, yet much happier.</em></p>
    <h3>Third Witch</h3>
    <p><em>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none. So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</em></p>
    <p>In this scene, the three witches greet Macbeth with three titles: Thane of Glamis, Thane of Cawdor, and future King of Scotland; foretelling his rise to power.
      They also speak to Banquo, offering paradoxical prophecies: he will be <em>“lesser than Macbeth and greater,”</em> <em>“not so happy, yet much happier,”</em> 
      and though he won’t be king himself, his descendants will be kings. These cryptic messages spark ambition and foreshadow the tension between fate, power, 
      and legacy.</p>

    <h3>Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 1</h3>
    <p><em>”Is this a dagger which I see before me,
            This handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
            I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
            Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
            To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but
            A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
            Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?” </em></p>
    <h3>Macbeth, Act 2, Scene 2</h3>
    <p><em>Whence is that knocking? –
           How is’t with me, when every noise appalls me?
          What hands are here! Ha, they pluck out mine eyes.
          Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
          Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
          The multitudinous seas incarnadine,
          Making the green one red."</em></p>
    <p>In these pivotal scenes, Macbeth wrestles with his conscience before and after murdering King Duncan. 
      In Scene 1, he hallucinates a floating dagger leading him toward Duncan’s chamber; a symbol of his inner turmoil and violent intent.
      He questions whether the dagger is real or a projection of his “heat-oppressed brain,” revealing his psychological descent.</p>
    <p>In Scene 2, after committing the murder, Macbeth is overwhelmed by guilt and paranoia. He’s haunted by every sound, unable to say “Amen,” 
      and fixated on the blood on his hands. He wonders if even “Neptune’s ocean” could wash away the guilt, concluding that his crime has stained 
      everything; turning “the green one red.” These scenes mark the beginning of Macbeth’s unraveling, as ambition gives way to psychological torment.</p>
