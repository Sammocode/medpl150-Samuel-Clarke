    <h1>What is Art</h1>

    <p> Art is the expression or application of human creativity, and to me, it is that emotion of freedom that takes the mind out of politics or drama unless 
it's a narrative story, including exploring adventure in other media such as books, movies, cartoons, video games, etc. It takes skill and imagination, typically 
  in a visual form, to appreciate primarily for their beauty or emotional power. </p>
