    <h2 style="font-family:verdana" >What is Art?</h2>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> Art is the expression or application of human creativity, and to me, it is that emotion of freedom that 
      takes the mind out of politics or controversial drama unless it's a narrative story, including exploring adventure or satirical social noir events 
      in other media such as books, movies/televisions, animations, video games, etc. It takes skill and imagination, typically in a visual form, 
      to appreciate primarily for their beauty or emotional power. </p>

     <h2 style="font-family:verdana"> Ways of seeing!</h2>
    
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> While I might agree with the Middle Ages men seeing hell as a firey place. 
      However, some people today may think or experience it as either in another dimension, 
      hell instead of underground earth, or just blackness of nothingness. Now with the photography,
      I agree with the image as a reproduction piece of history in a time and place. 
      Photography can be based on someone's perspective, which goes for an image too,
      and also tells the personality of the person. In general, in a way of seeing me,
      there is more meaning in seeing and thinking than in the original intention of the subject matter.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana"> Style Wars </h2>
    
  <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> In the film Style Wars is the defining of hip hop dancing, breaking, a graffiti artist.
    They call themselves writers, but actually, they are really artists working across all forms
    of spray-paint graffiti around the subway. The art around the city acknowledges these dissenting 
    sides without ceding to authority. Many think that the art they created is a sign of criminal offense,
    such as pickpocketing and murder. Authorities say it “They’re all in the same area of destroying our 
    lifestyle and making it difficult to enjoy life,”. </p>
  
<p style="font-family:'Courier New"> In reality, this isn't about the authority vs the artist; it's about the artist and the bomber affecting the art of others.
  It's Nice to see a city in the wasteland adding color to it, or otherwise it's just the greyness of an underwhelming city. 
  There were even names that were graffiti around the city in the sake of fame. It challenges society on the works of art, opening 
  a deeper meaning of how kids in the 80s feel when exploring their sense of freedom. Watching the film now, it felt like an original 
  story, and how I came to be of many incredible truths: that graffiti wasn’t a gateway to violence but an escape from it. </p>

<h2 style="font-family:verdana"> The Radiant Child </h2>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> While watching the film "The Radiant Child," when compared to Style Wars talks about the life of an artist perspective when it comes to crimes,
      drugs, or other shady activities. The interest in graffiti is common among young people as it was on walls and other transportation in both films,
      \taking place in the late 70s and early 80s in New York. Style Wars was a documentary, they see graffiti as a sign of writing and self-claim, 
      and get away from authorities, so-called writers showing how the kids felt when it comes to expression, and breakdancing. On the other hand, 
      Radiant Child is about Jean Michell Basquiat, a multilingual person that is unique among other people at the time. Jean is from a higher-class
      area, who also enjoys graffiti, but also has family issues, and found love through art in the Manhattan club with his mentor, Andy Warhol. </p>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> However, there is a difference between the two films in that Jean, unlike the kids in Style Wars, did get fame, being well-known in the art world.
      Jean's life isn't always happy. He had a mental issue with drugs, especially with the death of Andy Warhol's impact on his life situation. But he did
      overcome the situation with the help of art inspiration and friends along the way, making Jean the most influential artist of all time. Both films' 
      artwork throughout their filmography is cartoony, abstract, vibrant, and varied, meaning their passion for the artwork they produced. But their stories
      are dark, cynical, somber, and a swan song, yet beautiful characters in them that make you feel sympathetic for their tragedy, without them, 
      there wouldn't be any depth to the art world and its history.</p>
