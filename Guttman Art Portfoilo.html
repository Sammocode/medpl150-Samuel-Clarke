    <h2 style="font-family:verdana" >What is Art</h2>

    <p style="font-family:'Courier New" > Art is the expression or application of human creativity, and to me, it is that emotion of freedom that 
      takes the mind out of politics or drama unless it's a narrative story, including exploring adventure or satirical social noir events 
      in other media such as books, movies/televisions, animations, video games, etc. It takes skill and imagination, typically in a visual form, 
      to appreciate primarily for their beauty or emotional power. </p>
