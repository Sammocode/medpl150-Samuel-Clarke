    <p style="font-family:'Courier New" >For the first image, I chose The Baker Bridge Entrance Art, a 1920x1080 widescreen image, 
      because it is art located on campus, and I think it looks neat. While its history is named after Patty and Baker Bridge, 
      which helps to connect within campus, its orange color is striking, but I wanted to make it more vibrant. So for my editing,
      using Photoshop to make the color more dynamic, it contains both layers and channels before export from ARW (raw) to JPG. 
      For the layers themselves, I experimented with using the hue/saturation 1 mask above the original image; the smart filters 
      contain different colors and textures, including Solarize, Oil Paint, and Diffuse. I adjusted the RGB/16-bit channels to 
      introduce more colours while maintaining the original image's essence.</p>
