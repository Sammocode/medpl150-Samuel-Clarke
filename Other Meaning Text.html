     <h2>Our Personal Cave</h2>
     <h3>To Ouote the line from "The Allegory of The Cave" that you think might be most useful for your personal growth. Briefly explain why this line resonates with you.</h3>

    <h2>The Allegory of the Cave</h2>
    <p class="courier">In the relatable dialogue from Plato's "The Allegory of the Cave", there is one quote that I can relate to my personal struggles in my situation.
      The lines that said that were closer to me were <em> “Now if he was forced to look directly at the firelight, wouldn’t his eyes be pained?” </em> 
      I chose this specific line because after the pandemic and the use to staying online for years, after the announcement of being back in person,
      even before that me I didn't use to get too adapted online because that's where I didn't grow up, I'm not used to it with online sucks for me.
      Now that I'm back in person, I've tried to get back in person. I hurt to go back and forward, and it started to piss me off. My wellness instructor 
      always said that I needed to sacrifice my day so in the long term, I could relax sometime if the work was worth it discomfort today, comfort tomorrow.
      It pained me to think, and the forced to learn was hard even when I have a learning disability, but I must do it so I can accomplish more to make my 
      life worth something. Often, I may not like it first, but it helps me to be a better adult in responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Malcolm, Media, and Identity</h2>
    <h3> Malcolm X once said, “The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and
      to make the guilty innocent.”  Given that you have now read some both Dr. King and Malcolm X's self-portrayals in their own words, reflect on the importance 
      of telling one's own story. What have you learned additionally about each man through his own words? Why is it important that you tell your own story outside 
      of stereotypes and popular media?</h3>

    <h2 class="courier"> Malcolm X, the Man and anyone own words towards Media </h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> What I've learned is that a man's words can be truthful and can influence people through justice or fate, but some people can take them the wrong way.
      Some mythology can frame them oppositely, both can influence each other, and face challenges, including racism. It is very important to tell your own story
      because you know the story and the truth, like in independent publishing, but the mainstream media and stereotypes can be very dangerous, especially when lies,
      bias, and hypocrisy can portray you in a bad light, and you know the truth and portray it better than anyone else to be accurate. </p>
