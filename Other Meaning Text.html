     <h2>Our Personal Cave</h2>
     <h3>To Ouote the line from "The Allegory of The Cave" that you think might be most useful for your personal growth. Briefly explain why this line resonates with you.</h3>

    <h2>The Allegory of the Cave</h2>
    <p class="courier">In the relatable dialogue from Plato's "The Allegory of the Cave", there is one quote that I can relate to my personal struggles in my situation.
      The lines that said that were closer to me were <em> “Now if he was forced to look directly at the firelight, wouldn’t his eyes be pained?” </em> 
      I chose this specific line because after the pandemic and the use to staying online for years, after the announcement of being back in person,
      even before that me I didn't use to get too adapted online because that's where I didn't grow up, I'm not used to it with online sucks for me.
      Now that I'm back in person, I've tried to get back in person. I hurt to go back and forward, and it started to piss me off. My wellness instructor 
      always said that I needed to sacrifice my day so in the long term, I could relax sometime if the work was worth it discomfort today, comfort tomorrow.
      It pained me to think, and the forced to learn was hard even when I have a learning disability, but I must do it so I can accomplish more to make my 
      life worth something. Often, I may not like it first, but it helps me to be a better adult in responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Malcolm, Media, and Identity</h2>
    <h3> Malcolm X once said, “The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and
      to make the guilty innocent.”  Given that you have now read some both Dr. King and Malcolm X's self-portrayals in their own words, reflect on the importance 
      of telling one's own story. What have you learned additionally about each man through his own words? Why is it important that you tell your own story outside 
      of stereotypes and popular media?</h3>

    <h2 class="courier"> Malcolm X and the Media Fracture </h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> Malcolm X’s relationship with media reveals a deeper truth about identity, power, and perception. His words are just raw, 
      unfiltered, and rooted in justice, helding potential to influence millions of people. Yet mainstream outlets often distorted those words, framing him as a threat 
      rather than a thinker. This wasn’t an misrepresentation; it was a calculated manipulation that reflected broader systems of racism and control. In contrast to
      Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the other hand, was often portrayed as the peaceful, palatable face of the civil rights movement; his calls for nonviolence and integration widely
      broadcasted and embraced by white audiences. But even that portrayal was selective, often omitting his critiques of capitalism, militarism, and systemic 
      inequality. Both men understood that mythology and media could work together to reshape public perception, turning truth into controversy and resistance into danger. Their legacies remind us that even the most honest voices can be twisted when filtered through biased lenses.</p>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> That’s why self-authorship is important. In a world where stereotypes, lies, and hypocrisy dominate the narrative, telling your own story becomes a form of
    resistance. Independent publishing, masses media, and direct evidence allow individuals to reclaim their justice and present it with coherence and intention. 
    Malcolm X didn’t just speak; he documented, corrected, and clarified. Dr. King, too, used his writings and speeches to push beyond the cleaned image, revealing a 
    radical vision for truth within. Both men knew that the most accurate portrayal of a person comes internal, not from external systems built to distort. 
    Their lives stand as blueprints for how identity, media, and how truth intersect, and why our rights must be protected, especially when it challenges the status quo. 
    Through self-authorship, we don’t just tell our stories; we define them, on our own terms.  </p>
