    <h2 style="font-family:verdana">The Allegory of the Cave </h2>\
    <p>In the relatable dialogue from Plato's "The Allegory of the Cave", there is one quote that I can relate to my personal struggles in my situation.
      The lines that said that were closer to me were <em> “Now if he was forced to look directly at the firelight, wouldn’t his eyes be pained?” </em> 
      I chose this specific line because after the pandemic and the use to staying online for years, after the announcement of being back in person,
      even before that me I didn't use to get too adapted online because that's where I didn't grow up, I'm not used to it with online sucks for me.
      Now that I'm back in person, I've tried to get back in person. I hurt to go back and forward, and it started to piss me off. My wellness instructor 
      always said that I needed to sacrifice my day so in the long term, I could relax sometime if the work was worth it discomfort today, comfort tomorrow.
      It pained me to think, and the forced to learn was hard even when I have a learning disability, but I must do it so I can accomplish more to make my 
      life worth something. Often, I may not like it first, but it helps me to be a better adult in responsibility.</p>
