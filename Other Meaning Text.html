     <h2>Our Personal Cave</h2>
     <h3>To Ouote the line from "The Allegory of The Cave" that you think might be most useful for your personal growth. Briefly explain why this line resonates with you.</h3>

    <h2>The Allegory of the Cave</h2>
    <p class="courier">In the relatable dialogue from Plato's "The Allegory of the Cave", there is one quote that I can relate to my personal struggles in my situation.
      The lines that said that were closer to me were <em> “Now if he was forced to look directly at the firelight, wouldn’t his eyes be pained?” </em> 
      I chose this specific line because after the pandemic and the use to staying online for years, after the announcement of being back in person,
      even before that me I didn't use to get too adapted online because that's where I didn't grow up, I'm not used to it with online sucks for me.
      Now that I'm back in person, I've tried to get back in person. I hurt to go back and forward, and it started to piss me off. My wellness instructor 
      always said that I needed to sacrifice my day so in the long term, I could relax sometime if the work was worth it discomfort today, comfort tomorrow.
      It pained me to think, and the forced to learn was hard even when I have a learning disability, but I must do it so I can accomplish more to make my 
      life worth something. Often, I may not like it first, but it helps me to be a better adult in responsibility.</p>

    <h2>Malcolm, Media, and Identity</h2>
    <h3> Malcolm X once said, “The media’s the most powerful entity on earth. They have the power to make the innocent guilty and
      to make the guilty innocent.”  Given that you have now read some both Dr. King and Malcolm X's self-portrayals in their own words, reflect on the importance 
      of telling one's own story. What have you learned additionally about each man through his own words? Why is it important that you tell your own story outside 
      of stereotypes and popular media?</h3>

    <h2 class="courier"> Malcolm X and the Media Fracture </h2>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> Malcolm X’s relationship with media reveals a deeper truth about identity and power. His words are often raw, 
      unfiltered, and rooted in justice, he had the potential to influence millions. Yet the media, especially mainstream outlets, frequently distorted those words,
      framing him as a threat rather than a thinker. This wasn’t just misrepresentation, it was a strategic reframing that reflected broader systems of racism 
      and control. Malcolm understood that mythology and media could work together to reshape public perception, often turning truth into controversy. 
      His legacy reminds us that even the most honest voice can be twisted when filtered through biased lenses. </p>
    <p style="font-family:'Courier New">
      That’s why self-authorship is essential. In a world where stereotypes and hypocrisy can dominate the narrative, telling your own story becomes a form 
      of resistance. Independent publishing, grassroots media, and direct testimony allow individuals to reclaim their truth and present it with clarity. 
      Malcolm X didn’t just speak; he documented, corrected, and clarified. He knew that the most accurate portrayal of a person comes from within, not from
      external systems built to distort. His life stands as a blueprint for how identity, media, and justice intersect; and why truth must be protected, especially 
      when it challenges the status quo.</p>
