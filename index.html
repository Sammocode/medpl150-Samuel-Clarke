        <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    
    <p>As a university student majoring in Media Studies with a concentration in Emerging Media at Hunter College, 
      I am focused on developing skills in game development, story writing, animation, and interactive design. 
      My academic path includes a Film Minor for writing, and a Business Studies Certificate, which helps me better within the media industry of production. 
      Before I.T., I also did art in high school, which was character designs. I also hold an associate degree in Information Technology from Guttman Community College,
      where I studied the basic skills in web development (HTML/CSS), Java IDE Programming, and Networking. 
      I am interested in developing my own digital media that explores emotional resonance while offering new modes of engagement, 
      especially in character-driven environments.<p/>

        <p>
          My current focus is on creating original IPs to strengthen my ability to create interactive media that combines technical precision with narrative clarity.
          This will combine animation, narrative structure, and gameplay mechanics. I enjoy a variety of interests in media, spanning from video games, animation, 
          and visual storytelling, and I plan to apply these skills towards building my original projects and studio ventures. I am to expand my technical flow 
          and creative control, preparing for future work in game development and media production. This statement is additional to my portfolio by defining my 
          academic direction and creative goals for the semester.</p>
