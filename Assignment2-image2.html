    <p style="font-family:'Courier New"> For the second image, I chose The Hunter Stone Behind a Glass Wall, a 5”x7” vertical format image, because it is an art piece
      located outside of campus, and I think it looks amazing. While its history is quite unknown to me, it's a cool monument of a chisel stone piece; 
      the lighting makes the grey color more unique, but still could have been better. So for my editing, using Photoshop to make the subject stand out,
      it also contains both layers and channels before export from ARW (raw) to JPG. For the layers, I experimented by using the portrait to separate the
      stone subject from the blurred background. The altered background contrasts with the darker stone, which stands out due to gradients and curve 
      chart adjustments that enhance its dynamic design. The RGB/16-bit channels were selectively modified to enhance the color palette while 
      preserving the integrity of the original image. </p>
