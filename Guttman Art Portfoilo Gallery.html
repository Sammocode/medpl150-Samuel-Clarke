    <h2>What is Art? & Ways of Seeing Artifact</h2>
    <p>Art is the expression or application of human creativity, and to me, it is that emotion of freedom that takes the mind out of politics or controversial 
      drama unless it's a narrative storyincluding exploring adventure in other media such as books, movies, cartoons, video games, etc. It takes skill and 
      imagination, typically in a visual form, to appreciate primarily for their beauty or emotional power.</p>
    <p>While I might agree with the Middle Ages men seeing hell as a firey place. However, some people today may think or experience it as either in 
      another dimension, hell instead of underground earth, or just blackness of nothingness. Now with the photography, I agree with the image as a 
      reproduction piece of history in a time and place. Photography can be based on someone's perspective, which goes for an image too, and also tells
      the personality of the person. In general, in a way of seeing me, there is more meaning in seeing and thinking than in the original intention of 
      the subject matter.</p>

    <h2>Style Wars (1983)</h2>
    <p>In the film Style Wars is the defining of hip hop dancing, breaking, a graffiti artist. They call themselves writers, but actually,
      they are really artists working across all forms of spray-paint graffiti around the subway. The art around the city acknowledges these
      dissenting sides without ceding to authority. Many think that the art they created is a sign of criminal offense, such as pickpocketing and murder. 
      Authorities say it “They’re all in the same area of destroying our lifestyle and making it difficult to enjoy life,”. </p>
    <p>In reality, this isn't about the authority vs the artist; it's about the artist and the bomber affecting the art of others. 
      It's Nice to see a city in the wasteland adding color to it, or otherwise it's just the greyness of an underwhelming city. 
      There were even names that were graffiti around the city in the sake of fame. It challenges society on the works of art, 
      opening a deeper meaning of how kids in the 80s feel when exploring their sense of freedom. Watching the film now, it felt
      like an original story, and how I came to be of many incredible truths: that graffiti wasn’t a gateway to violence but an escape from it.</p>

    <h2>The Radiant Child (2010)</h2>
    <p>While watching the film "The Radiant Child," when compared to Style Wars talks about the life of an artist perspective when it comes to crimes, drugs, 
      or other shady activities. The interest in graffiti is common among young people as it was on walls and other transportation in both films, taking place 
      in the late 70s and early 80s in New York. Style Wars was a documentary, they see graffiti as a sign of writing and self-claim, and get away from authorities,
      so-called writers showing how the kids felt when it comes to expression, and breakdancing. On the other hand, Radiant Child is about Jean Michell Basquiat, 
      a multilingual person that is unique among other people at the time. Jean is from a higher-class area, who also enjoys graffiti, but also has family issues,
      and found love through art in the Manhattan club with his mentor, Andy Warhol.</p>
    <p>However, there is a difference between the two films in that Jean, unlike the kids in Style Wars, did get fame, being well-known in the art world. 
      Jean's life isn't always happy. He had a mental issue with drugs, especially with the death of Andy Warhol's impact on his life situation. But he did 
      overcome the situation with the help of art inspiration and friends along the way, making Jean the most influential artist of all time. Both films' 
      artwork throughout their filmography is cartoony, abstract, vibrant, and varied, meaning their passion for the artwork they produced. But their stories
      are dark, cynical, somber, and a swan song, yet beautiful characters in them that make you feel sympathetic for their tragedy, without them, there wouldn't
      be any depth to the art world and its history.</p>

    <h2>Figure Reflections</h2>

    <p><strong>Figure 1–3:</strong> These are examples of sketches from my sketchbook, most of which are original works... Among Us reference included.</p>
    <p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Coming home, I treated myself to Cold Stone ice cream—simple joy, captured.</p>
    <p><strong>Figure 4:</strong> Celebrated my high school graduation at Clement's Crab House. This photo is from another day, but the memory remains.</p>
    <p><strong>Figure 6–7:</strong> My consoles—Switch, PS3, Xbox 360—each with equal value. Their games influence my artwork without rivalry.</p>
    <p><strong>Figure 8–9:</strong> At 898 St. Nicholas Avenue, I observed women of color whose hairstyles reflected resilience and individuality.</p>
    <p><strong>Figure 11:</strong> I visited 45th Street in Manhattan, went ice skating, and paid for it myself. Not perfect, but present.</p>

    <h2>Photography Changes Everything / Relationship with Photography</h2>

    <p>Throughout my life, the relationship with photography the used is sometimes not too much in the sake of social media but not too little with taking pictures 
      of interesting images. But I do love taking pictures of food to make sure that I won't forget those moments, or an image that I can remind myself of what I'm 
      supposed to do on those days. Even when it comes to memory, I take pictures when it comes to the best locations in New York when it comes to trips and the 
      things I've never seen before. Heck, if I hang out with my friend, he always wanted me to be a cameraman when it comes to videotaping stunts for his video 
      on social media, I might not be the best, but trying my best to make quality for his video. In high school, I took pictures of the art wall painted 
      through either my work for someone else, because it looked good, and inspired me for my future works.</p>
    
    <p>When it comes to proof, I sketch out an artwork even before it is in detail to make sure I don't plagiarize other artists. 
      When using my phone to take a photo, it's not the best one in town, but I edit to make sure it looks decent when making a proper image.
      Sometimes, when watching YouTube tech videos about smartphones, they always talk about how great the cameras are and how they improve each year,
      including comparing them to a real camera and how realistic it gets. When I use a photo, I get a reference to make sure it is either accurate to
      what to draw or compare to my memories to see how it made it different. The nostalgia hit my brain; my parent used a lot of photos to remember how 
      great the past was and how it impacted me growing up to be a better person.</p>

    <h2>All About Collages (Community College)</h2>
    <p>The motivation and Inspiration behind these two collage pieces was to distinguish one from the other. The first one was my first time using a digital 
      computer instead of making it by hand. I know that the collage is not perfect, but it's something. I used to use the program Befunky to mishmash my style
      so the landscape wouldn't be boring. While my peer uses about themselves (don't worry, I use that for my second collage). The first one was to unleased my
      creative motive to the limit of shifting to a normal house setting and make a story about it as if it took place in another world. The first picture was 
      about Such as Mario in The Cabin of hell trying to protect his ice cream from an Evil Creature and where to escape. The inspiration for the first one was
      complex, but I was influenced by other artists by using stock photos and combining them into one big piece. Now for the second one is not like the first 
      one, but it's about me and my drawing and sketches connect to me so much, and mostly by hand. I, as a person, am mundane; most of these old pictures are 
      just me in high school in different outfits of variations. I do have some struggles with having the best face, I just know that not everyone is not perfect.
      I'm glad that I am flawed and appreciate who I am as a person. Without these sketches and artwork all over the years, I'm nothing, to be honest.</p>
