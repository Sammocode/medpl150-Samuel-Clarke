      <h2 style="font-family:verdana">Photography and Image Making: A Reflection Inspired by Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave”</h2>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">
        When reading a chapter of Susan Sontag’s “In Plato’s Cave,” photography is not as passive documentation, 
        but rather a powerful act of framing reality, an editorial gesture that shapes how we see, remember, and interpret the world.
        For me, image making is not just about capturing what’s in front of the camera lens; it’s about isolating emotional truth from visual
        clutter (the focus on that subject away from the background being blurry). Whether I’m editing a photo for a website or writing my 
        opinions about the media shaping people, I’m always asking myself: <em> What does this image say when stripped of context? 
          And what context do I choose to restore?</em> </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'" >Ever since I remember reading “In Plato's Cave” for an assignment in community college, my English professor was a well-known photographer 
        within the people of color community, capturing the daily lives of unique people and putting them through a museum just to interact and find
        the meanings within the language of photography. Photography, when practiced, is a form of capturing absurd rarity or curiosity. I've edited 
        photos on my phone, from family moments to special events, maintaining subtle clarity in the background to reframe, not erase, their history. 
        I’ve built character designs, sketches, and creative writing that use visual contrast to bring to mind symbolic meaning. 
        Each image is like a gesture of looking deeper, a boundary-setting act that says: <em>This is what I choose to remember. This is how I choose to see.</em> 
      </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Sontag had warned us of the camera’s power to objectify, to turn people into subjects and moments into trophies. 
        The camera was sold like a predatory weapon, one that is as automatic a capture as possible, ready to spring at the trigger like a gun.
        I resist that by treating each project as part of a larger emotional personal arc. Across these ten assignments this semester, 
        I won’t just be switching tools; I’ll be consistent in building a portfolio of work that reflects my evolving relationship with visual technical media. 
        From photography to illustration, from Photoshop to image-text hybrids within a website using HTML/CSS, 
        I’ll be exploring how visuals can carry emotional weight, symbolic depth, and narrative clarity. </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">In representing our modern world, I’m drawn to contrast: the tension between digital saturation and emotional authenticity.
        A single photo of a quiet background street of Brooklyn can say more than a thousand filtered selfies of a human being. 
        A graphic that contrasts archival footage with contemporary still images has the potential to bring up generational tensions, 
        similar to those observed within animation and gaming franchises I have researched and analyzed. By utilizing both imagery and text, 
        my objective is to examine concepts of belonging and transition, as well as satirically illustrate the journey from the "weave tumbles" 
        of disorder to the "garden" of coherence. Today’s cameras aren’t toys, they’re fixtures in our environment, shaping how we confirm and consume reality., touchstones and confirmation to prove of reductive approach to reality which is considered realistic.
        Photographs are seen as information to users who aren't read-savvy, but instead visual learners; photography is a camera record. </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> This personal ethic informs not just how I see, but how I build, across platforms, across assignments. Each project will be a scene in that arc. The first may be raw, the second more refined, and by the tenth, I hope to arrive at a visual language 
        that feels fully integrated. I’ll use photography not just to capture, but to curate. I’ll use illustration and Photoshop not just to decorate, 
        but to symbolize. And I’ll use image-text combinations to speak in layered tones, where what’s seen and what’s said reinforce each other. 
        The limit of photographic knowledge of the world is that, while it can gain consciousness, it can never be ethical or political knowledge.
        Today, everything exists to end in a photograph. </p>
      <p style="font-family:'Courier New'"> This isn’t just my required coursework but rather my creative arc journey within the portfolio 
        I'm producing. And like Sontag’s Plato’s cave, I’m stepping out of the cave, not just into light, but into the lens. Not just to see, 
        but to frame the world with satirical criticism. My portfolio isn’t a record, it’s a reckoning.</p>
